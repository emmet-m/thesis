\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{ack}

This work has been inspired by the labours of numerous academics in
the Faculty of Engineering at UNSW who have endeavoured, over the years, to
encourage students to present beautiful concepts using beautiful
typography.

Further inspiration has come from Donald Knuth who designed \TeX, for
typesetting technical (and non-technical) material with elegance and
clarity; and from Leslie Lamport who contributed \LaTeX, which makes
\TeX\ usable by mortal engineers.

John Zaitseff, an honours student in CSE at the time, created the
first version of the UNSW Thesis \LaTeX\ class and the author of the
current version is indebted to his work.
