\chapter{Background}\label{ch:background}

Every semester, students ask their supervisor how to write their thesis,
what the requirements are, and what to write in it.  
This document tries to answer all such questions.

\section{Previous work}

Previously, Nooshabadi~\cite{Noo05} has descried style-related thesis
requirements, Shepherd~\cite{She05} has provided \LaTeX\ templates while
other academics have discussed contents with their students.  This work
draws all the relevant information regarding thesis writing into one
document.  The present template/document is heavily influenced by
Nooshabadi and Shepherd, incorporating requirements from The Graduate
Research School~\cite{GRS14} for Higher Degree Research theses.
