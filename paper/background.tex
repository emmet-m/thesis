\chapter{Background \& Related Works}\label{ch:background}
\liam{No ampersands.}\\
Our investigation of existing works will consider 3\liam{three, not 3} domains;\liam{colon, not semi} The existing tools within Cogent,
termination and recursive types, \liam{and} linear and uniqueness types.

\section{Termination \& Recursive Types}
\liam{No ampersands}\\
Our focus for reasoning about termination falls on considering the use of Isabelle to verify our 
embedding as well as facilitating the ease of this process at the type level within Cogent. 
\liam{Little unclear on this paragraph. I'll wait till you write more.}
