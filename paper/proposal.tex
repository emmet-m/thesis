\chapter{Proposal and Plan}\label{ch:style}

Considering our investigation, we seek to expand on the existing Cogent infrastructure keeping in mind
two major requirements; the necessity for our programs to be probably \textit{total}, and preserving the
guarantees of Cogent's uniqueness types system.

\subsection{Preserving totality}

We will require that our recursive types be \textit{strictly positive}, such as \textit{Agda},
\textit{Coq} and \textit{Isabelle} in order to produce a cleaner and easier to reason about
embedding within Isabelle. This will allow our types to be compatible with Isabelle, and potentially
produce an induction principle within Isabelle to reason about these types directly.

In addition to this, \textit{strictly positive} types allow us to avoid expressions that are infinite,
of which iterating over would potentially cause an infinite loop and thus nontermination. Consider
the following example in \textit{Haskell} using GADT syntax:

\pagebreak
\begin{center}
    \lstinputlisting[language=haskell]{content/NegativeType.hs}
\end{center}

By our definition in \todo{REFERENCE}, we can see that our type constructor is \textit{negative}, and
infinite loop. Although this example was constructed maliciously, there may be situations where the
allows us to construct an expression \verb|infiniteExpression| that when iterated over causes an
programmer may accidentally construct such an expression, which strictly positive types prohibit.
