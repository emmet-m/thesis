Formal verification is the field of computer science that explores the methods that allow us to
  reason rigorously about the functional correctness of programs we write. 
Much effort has specifically been put into the verification of low level systems code,
  which is critical to the operation of any computer.
Using C to implement this code is a very popular choice in the systems community,
  however due to the nature of the language many difficulties arise when trying to
  reason about the functional properties of C code.

Cogent\cite{OCo16}, is a domain specific language that was introduced to address these issues.
It is a functional, high level, linearly typed language with a certifying compiler
  that produces a shallow embedding in Isabelle (the interactive theorem prover) as well as low level efficient C code,
  the semantics of which correspond to the proof in the Isabelle embedding.
This embedding is easy to reason about within Isabelle due to it's functional,
  high level nature, which in term allows for a much less taxing process of verifying low level systems code. 

Cogent is also suitable for low level systems development,
  as its linear type system allows for both efficient destructive updates as well as static memory allocation.
In addition to this, Cogent presents a C FFI allowing existing C programs to interact with Cogent code without having to
  abandon a project already written in C and already verified.

Cogent however has no support for recurison or iteration. 
Currently, any iterative data type and its iterators have to be defined externally in C,
  and included in the Cogent program via its C FFI.
As it is desirable to prove totality about verified code,
  the cost of reasoning about a particular programs termination is exacerbated with this overhead,
  due to iteration being an external construct to the language.
This forces the verification effort to again reason about low level C code, which Cogent strives to avoid.

This thesis aims to introduce recursive types to Cogent's type system, allowing internal iteration over
  internal data structures without the involvement of C code.
While providing these benefits, we must also respect the existing guarantees that Cogent enjoys,
  particularly simple reasoning about functional correctness (especially with respect to termination and totality),
  its static memory allocation and destructive updates all whilst keeping in mind
  an efficient and low level system C representation.
