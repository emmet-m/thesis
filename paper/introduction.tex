\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}

Having a set of clear requirements to their thesis is important to student
finalising their BE, or other, degree.  Such requirements are both in
relation to the physical appearance of the thesis, as well as the writing
style and organisation.  The present document tries to concisely state the
theses requirements while appearing in layout and structure as a thesis
itself.

Chapter~\ref{ch:background} explains the background for this document.
Chapter~\ref{ch:style} states the style and submission related requirements
to theses submitted at the school.
Chapter~\ref{ch:content} explains content related requirements to theses.
Chapter~\ref{ch:eval} evaluates the thesis requirements template.  Finally,
Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusion} draws up conclusions and suggest ways to
further improve the thesis requirements template.
