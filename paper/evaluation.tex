\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:eval}

This chapter is mainly provided for the purpose of showing a typical thesis
structure.  There are no more thesis requirements described.

\section{Results}

The result of this work is the present document, being both a \LaTeX\
template and a thesis requirement specification.

\section{Discussion}

The Dual function of this document somewhat de-emphasises the primary
purpose of the document, namely the thesis requirements.  It would be
better, if these could be stated on a few concise pages (cf Appendix
1, p\pageref{app1}).
