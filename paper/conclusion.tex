\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

A thesis requirements/template document has been created.  This serves the
dual purposes of giving students specific requirements to their theses ---
both style and content related --- while providing a typical thesis
structure in a \LaTeX\ template.

\section{Future Work}

Extract the requirements from the template in order to have very concise
requirements.
