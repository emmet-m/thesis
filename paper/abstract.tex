\chapter*{Abstract}\label{abstract}

Cogent is a linearly-typed functional programming language written in Haskell for writing trustworthy and efficient systems code.
It has a certifying compiler that produces C code, a shallow embedding in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover,
  and an Isabelle/HOL proof that the C code refines the shallow embedding.
Cogent's linear type system ensures desired properties such as memory-safety and it also allows the compiler to generate efficient C code.

Cogent currently has no support for recursion, instead it has a foreign function interface (FFI) to C.
Data-types, as well as iterators over these types, are implemented in C and called by Cogent code using the FFI.

The main task of this project is to add a restricted form of recursion to Cogent while keeping the language total.
This would enable defining more data-types as well as iterators over these data-types directly in Cogent rather than resorting to C.
