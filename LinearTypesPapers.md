[Summary](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs3161/18s2/Week%2009/Linear%20Types%20Notes.pdf)

Simple introduction to linear types.

### *Philip Wadler* - Linear types can change the world!

[Paper](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/linear/linear.ps)

* Another good intro to linear types/destructive update semantics

## Languages with substructural type systems


### [*Clean*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_(programming_language))

* Uniqueness types, concurrency and IO focused

### [*Idris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_(programming_language))

* Purely functional with dependant types
* Similar to Haskell
* Has to a small capacity, theorem proving capabilities


### [*Mercury*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(programming_language))

* Made in Melbourne!

### [*Rust*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language))

* Systems level goals with affine types
* Actively developed

### [*F\**](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar)

* Very actively developed
* [Had affine types](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/secure-distributed-programming-with-value-dependent-types/), were dropped in favour of monadic effects

### [*Linear ML*](https://github.com/pikatchu/LinearML)

* ML, but linear!

### [*Linear Haskell*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09756)

* Haskell, but linear!
