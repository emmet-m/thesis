\chapter*{Abstract}\label{abstract}

Cogent is a functional programming language with uniqueness types written in Haskell for writing trustworthy and efficient systems code.
It has a certifying compiler that produces C code, a shallow embedding in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover,
and an Isabelle/HOL proof that the C code refines the shallow embedding.
Cogent's uniqueness type system ensures desired properties such as memory-safety and it also allows the compiler to generate efficient C code.

Cogent currently has no support for recursion; instead it has a foreign function interface (FFI) to C.
Datatypes, as well as iterators over these types, are implemented in C and called by Cogent code using the FFI.

The main task of this project is to add a restricted form of recursion to Cogent while keeping the language total.
These recursive types would enable defining more datatypes as well as iterators over these datatypes directly in Cogent rather than resorting to C.
This would enable programmers to write more programs in Cogent without using external C, thus easing the verification effort
by allowing more use of Cogent's shallow embedding.
