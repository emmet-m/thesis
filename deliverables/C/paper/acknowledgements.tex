\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{ack}

Thanks to Liam, Kai and Christine for being great teachers and helping me break into the world
of formal methods, without your guidance I would never have been able to work in such an
exciting field.

Thanks again to Liam and Christine, as well as Vincent and Zilin for continuously helping
me work on my thesis, I've learned a lot from all of you and I'm extremely thankful to
have had the opportunity to learn beside you.

Thanks to my fantastic friends for supporting me and watching my health throughout my
university years: Nick, James Treloar, James Dowers, Danni, Ofir, Namsu, Andrew and many more!

Thanks especially to Liana for looking after me during the rough patches and supporting me
throughout the year, your support means the world to me.

Finally, thanks to my Mum and Dad for helping me get to this point. Without their
support, encouragement, and especially their wisdom throughout all my years of schooling and university,
I wouldn`t have been able to learn as much as I did.
