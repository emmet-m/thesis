\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{ack}

Thanks to Kai, Liam and Christine for being great teachers and helping me break into the world
of formal methods, without your guidance I would never have been able to work in such an
exciting field!
Thanks to my fantastic friends for supporting me and watching my health throughout my
university years: Nick, James, James, Danni, Ofir, Namsu and many more!
Thanks especially to Liana for looking after me during the rough patches and supporting me
throughout the year, your support means the world to me.
Finally, thanks to my Mum and Dad Cathy and Damian for helping me get to this point. Without their
support and encouragement throughout all my years of schooling and university,  I wouldn`t
have learned anything.
