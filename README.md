# Recursive Types for Cogent

This thesis introduces *recursive types* to the [Cogent](https://github.com/NICTA/cogent) programming language, which forms the basis for recursion and iteration without the use of Cogent's C FFI. Additionally, a pen-and-paper formalisation of a termination checker for the language is defined in order to assist with keeping Cogent functions total and terminating.

A copy of the paper is [here](paper.pdf), with the source LaTeX [here](final_paper/).

The implementation in the model compiler `minigent` can be found [here](https://github.com/emmet-m/cogent).
